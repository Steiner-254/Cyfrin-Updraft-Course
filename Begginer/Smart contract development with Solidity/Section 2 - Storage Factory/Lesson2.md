# Setting the project

## What is Composability in Smart Contracts?
- One of the key aspects of blockchain development is the seamless and permissionless interaction among contracts, referred to as composability. This becomes especially important in decentralized finance (DeFi), where intricate financial products interact compatibly using the same smart contract interface.
In this lesson, we'll be creating a contract titled StorageFactory that will interact with and deploy our existing SimpleStorage contract.

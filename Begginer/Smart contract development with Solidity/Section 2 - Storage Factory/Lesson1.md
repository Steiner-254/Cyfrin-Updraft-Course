- Welcome back to our developer tutorial series! We've made our way to lesson three, where we'll dive deeper into the world of contracts, by discussing their deployment and interaction abilities. As always, all the resources for this session can be found in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-full-course-cu#lesson-3-remix-storage-factory). For this lesson, we'll focus on the Remix Storage Factory.

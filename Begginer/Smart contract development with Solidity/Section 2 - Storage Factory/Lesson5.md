# Use AI to help pt.1

## Introduction
- If you run into (a lot of) questions, it means that you are thinking critically and you are approaching the subject the right way. In this lesson, we'll do an AI-chat example and learn how to effectively ask questions. AI chat platforms like `ChatGPT` and `Bard` effectiveness of the answers.

## Ask questions effectively
- For example, let's say that you cannot understand the difference between simpleStorage and SimpleStorage very well:

```
simpleStorage = new SimpleStorage();
```

- We can ask the AI to clarify it by:
1. highlighting only the line(s) you're confused about and copy it
2. Paste these lines within your question in a code block format. You can create a code block by adding three backticks ``` before and three backticks after some text. This will explicitly indicate to the AI that you are referring to a piece of code and not just to a simple text.

- This is the AI prompt:

````

Hi, I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between these simple storages on this line:  ```// paste the confusing line of code here`` Here is my full code: ``` // paste the full code here`

````

## AI answer
- The AI can provide insightful and very comprehensive answers. For instance, an AI may indicate that simpleStorage is a variable of type SimpleStorage, which is a contract defined in the file SimpleStorage.sol.
- 👀❗IMPORTANT
>> AI systems are highly efficient at solving basic coding tasks. However, as the complexity of codebases and projects increases, the effectiveness of AI begins to diminish. Advanced tasks often require deep contextual understanding, innovative problem-solving, and area integrations where current AI capabilities fall short.

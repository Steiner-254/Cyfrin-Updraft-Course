## Working with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- One term that frequently comes up when talking about deploying code onto a blockchain network is `"EVM," which stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine.` Now, the EVM might seem like a complex term, but essentially it's a standard for how to compile and deploy smart contracts to a blockchain.
- For anyone interacting with the blockchain space, particularly those deploying smart contracts, understanding the basic functioning and application of the Ethereum virtual machine is invaluable.

## EVM Compatible Blockchains
-Any smart contract or solidity code you write can be deployed to any blockchain that is compatible with the EVM. Prime examples of such blockchains and Layer 2 solutions include `Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitram, Optimism, and Zksync.` Even though a blockchain, such as Zksync, might be EVM-compatible, it's critical to ensure that all keywords are compatible as some do not work with every EVM-compatible blockchain.

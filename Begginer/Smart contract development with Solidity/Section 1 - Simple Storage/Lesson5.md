# Arrays and structs

## Storing and Tracking Favorite Numbers in Our Contract
- Our smart contract, as is, does an excellent job. It primarily enables users to store their favorite numbers, update them, and view them later. Sounds brilliant, right? Yet, it has been specifically designed to store a single favorite number at a time. What if we wanted to maintain not just our favorite number, but others as well?
- In this lesson, we will explore how we can extend this functionality. We'll learn how to create a list of favorite numbers using `arrays`. Additionally, we will delve into using `structs` for creating new types in Solidity. Let's get started!

## Deploying A Simple Storage Contract On A Testnet
- If you’ve been following along through our work with simple storage contract, you will see that we have progressively added functionality to our solidity contract. With our favorite number feature, typing person, public list, favorite number retrieval, and update functions, we’ve built up a solid contract structure. Now, it’s time to steer away from abstract theorizing and practically deploy this to a real `testnet.`

## Pre-Deployment Audit
- `Make sure to write tests, carry out audits, and ensure the robustness of your contract before deploying it to production.`

## Compilation Check
- This ensures that our contract has no errors or warnings and is fit for deployment. Go to your development environment and ensure that you have a green checkmark, indicating a successful compilation.

# Errors and warnings

## Interpreting the Color Coding
- When working with Solidity, if we negligently eliminate something crucial from our code – like semicolon – and then try to compile, we are met with a stream of red error messages. - Whenever you see these red errors, it indicates that your code is not compiling. `In essence, Solidity isn't able to convert your written code into machine-readable form.`

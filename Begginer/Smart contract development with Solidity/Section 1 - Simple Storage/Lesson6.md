# Errors and warnings

## Interpreting the Color Coding
- When working with Solidity, if we negligently eliminate something crucial from our code – like semicolon – and then try to compile, we are met with a stream of red error messages. Whenever you see these red errors, it indicates that your code is not compiling. `In essence, Solidity isn't able to convert your written code into machine-readable form.`
- On another note, let's consider what happens when we delete the SPDX license identifier from the top of our code, then recompile. Instead of a sea of red, we get a yellow box alerting us to a warning, rather than an error.

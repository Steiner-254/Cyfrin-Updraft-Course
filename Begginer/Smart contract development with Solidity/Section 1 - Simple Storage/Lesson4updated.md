# Introduction
- In this lesson, you'll discover the basics of Remix and how to create and compile your first contract.

## Remix IDE
- Open Remix to get started.
- This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a powerful tool used to build and develop smart contracts in solidity. It helps to easily visualize and interact with our smart contracts. It contains a file explorer that hosts all the files, a solidity compiler and a tab where you can deploy your contracts.

1. ðŸ§¹ Remove all the existing files and folders by right-clicking on them (optional).
2. âœ¨ Create a new file, e.g., `SimpleStorage.sol`. The .sol extension tells the compiler that this is a Solidity file.

## AI and forums
- The barrier for entry into the world of software and blockchain engineering is smaller than ever. Inevitably we're going to run into problems while coding and knowing where and how to find solutions is an extremely valuable skill.
- Here are the exact 6 steps to solve any problem you may face.
1. Tinker
2. Ask Your AI
3. Read Docs
4. Web Search
5. Ask in a Forum
6. Ask on the Support Forum or GitHub
7. Iterate

- Lets go through them.

## Tinker
- Pinpoint your error, review your code manually making small adjustments you suspect may resolve the issue. Pinpointing the error in your code will help you frame your question/prompt in the next step.

## Ask Your AI
- There are several AI models available these days, each with their pros and cons. Here are a few to consider.
1. ChatGPT - The OG. This model offered by OpenAI is robust, multi-modal, includes code interpretion and can browse the web. The best quality unfortunately comes from the paid version.
2. Phind - This is a programming focused model with intuition allowing it to proactively ask questions to clarify assumptions. Can also browse the web, and has a VS Code extension!
3. Copilot - formerly Bing Chat, and not to be confused with the IDE AI assistant, Copilot is rapidly becoming Microsoft's whole ecosystem response to the age of AI
4. Google Bard - ehhhhh - results may vary.

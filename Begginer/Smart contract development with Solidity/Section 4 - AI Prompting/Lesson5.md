# Speedrun

## Speedrun
- In this section we're examining a resource that isn't explicitly part of this course but is highly useful in expanding your knowledge about Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This resource comes courtesy of my good friend Austin Griffin. Let's go over what it can do for you.

## Introduction to Speedrun Ethereum w/ Austin Griffin
- Austin Griffin, renowned for his conspicuous bow tie, is eager to help you kickstart your journey of creating on Ethereum through speedrunethereum.com. He's developed this resource to clarify the ‘HOW’ and ‘WHY’ behind Ethereum building.
- Through Speedrun Ethereum, you'll delve into a plethora of projects, including:

>> Creating a simple Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

>> Constructing a decentralized staking app

>> Developing a token vendor

>> Building a Dice Game - learning about randomness on chain

>> Creating a Decentralized Exchange (Dex)

>> Contructing and using a MultiSig Wallet

>> SVG NFTs and on chain Data

>> ...and much more

- To take advantage of these learning opportunities, visit [Speedrunethereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com/) and get started!

## Intro to Scaffold-ETH2
- `Scaffold-eth-2` is a great resource for those learning Solidity and trying to visualize what their code is doing.
- It provides a clean front-end UI that will update dynamically with your smart contract changes, allowing you to interact with it and monitor adjustments you've made.

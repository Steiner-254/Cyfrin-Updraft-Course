# Fund me introduction

## Introduction
- In this section, we'll create a `decentralized crowdfunding contract`. The complete codebase is available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-fund-me-cu).

## Overview
- For this project, we will be using two contracts: `FundMe`, the main crowdfunding contract, and `PriceConverter`. They function much like `Kickstarter`, allowing users to send any native blockchain cryptocurrency. They also enable the owner of the contract to withdraw all the funds collected. We will then deploy these contracts on a `testnet`.
- NOTE
>> Use testnet sparingly. Limiting testnet transactions helps prevent network congestion, ensuring a smoother testing experience for everyone.

# Project setup

## Introduction
- Let's begin by coding `FundMe`, a crowdfunding contract allowing users to send funds, which the owner can later `withdraw`. Before we start, let's clean up our Remix IDE workspace

## Setting up the project
- Start from scratch by opening your `Remix IDE` and deleting all existing contracts. Next, create a new contract named FundMe.
- 👀❗IMPORTANT

>> Before you start coding, try to `write down in plain English what you want your code to achieve`. This helps clarify your goals and structure your approach.

# Solidity for Loop

## Introduction
- In this tutorial, we'll set up the `withdraw` function to enable the retrieval of accumulated funds. We'll then reset all the `mappings to zero` using a method known as a for `loop`.

## For Loops
- A *`for loop`* is a widely-used concept in many programming languages that enables the execution of a block of code a repeated amount of times.
For example, consider this list:
```
//[1, 2, 3, 4] elements
// 0  1  2  3  indexes
```

- The elements of the list are the numbers 1 through 4, with indices ranging from 0 to 3: the number 1 is at index 0, the number 2 is at index 1, and so on. To access all the elements in this list, we can use their indexes.
- A typical `for loop` structure in programming languages involves:

>> - Initializing at some starting index
>> - Iterating until an end index
>> - Incrementing by certain steps

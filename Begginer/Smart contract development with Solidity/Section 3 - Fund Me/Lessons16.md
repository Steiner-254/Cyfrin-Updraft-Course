# Solidity for Loop

## Introduction
- In this tutorial, we'll set up the `withdraw` function to enable the retrieval of accumulated funds. We'll then reset all the `mappings to zero` using a method known as a for `loop`.

## For Loops
- A *`for loop`* is a widely-used concept in many programming languages that enables the execution of a block of code a repeated amount of times.
For example, consider this list:
```
//[1, 2, 3, 4] elements
// 0  1  2  3  indexes
```

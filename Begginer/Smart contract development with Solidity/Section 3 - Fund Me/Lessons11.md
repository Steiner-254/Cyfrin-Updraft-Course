# Solidity math

## Introduction
- In this lesson, we will guide you through converting the value of ETH to USD. We'll use the previously defined `getPrice` function within the new `getConversionRate` function.

## The `getPrice` and `getConversionRate` Functions
- The `getPrice` function returns the current value of Ethereum in USD as a uint256.
- The `getConversionRate` function converts a specified amount of ETH to its USD equivalent.

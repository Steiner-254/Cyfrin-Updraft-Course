## 1. Blockchain Basics

- [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
- [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
- **The Oracle Problem** in the context of blockchain and smart contracts refers to the challenge of integrating external data into these systems in a trustless manner. Smart contracts are designed to be autonomous and self-executing, but they rely on external data sources, known as oracles, to function properly. The issue arises because these oracles can be centralized and thus introduce a point of failure or manipulation, undermining the decentralized and trustless nature of blockchain technology.
- Everything  we do in life, is either an agreement or a contract in some aspect.
- **Decentralised exchanges (DEXs)** - are peer-to-peer marketplaces where cryptocurrency traders can make transactions directly without handing over management of their funds to an intermediary or custodian. These transactions are facilitated through the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements written in code.
- Examples of DEXs include UniSwap e.t.c
- Smart Contracts solve current world trust issues.
- Smart Contracts bring unbrakable promises.
- Bitcoin was the fisrt protocol to pick the Blockchain Technology and push it into mainstream.
- Chainlink allows developers to develop **Hybrid Smart Contracts** that link the onchain and off-chain.
- Decentralised Networks offers transparency and flexibility. 
- Speed & Efficiency - On transactions done on the blockchain networks. This is because all the transactions happen instantly.
- Smart Contracts are Immutable - they cannot be changed once deployed. 
- Security - To takeover data in the blockchain, one needs to takeover almost all the nodes which is quite impossible.
- DeFi = Decentralised Finance
- NFTs = Non-Fungible Tokens
- Using metamask to make transations.
- Loosing access to the `Secret Phrase`, results in loosing all your funds.
- Testing and Simulations of smart contracts should be done on local test networks that does not involve real money.
- `Sepolia` is one of the main `Ethereum` testnets for developers.
- [Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
- Adding different networks to `Metamask`.
- The complex your transaction is, the more gas you have to pay.
- Distributed Blockchain - Peer 2 Peer.
- Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
- Gas Rewards & EIP 1559.
- **Consensus** - is the mechanism used to agree on the state of the Blockchain.
-  Consensus is broken down into 2 types:
1. Chain Selection
2. Sybil Restistance

- 2 types of `Sybil Resistance` include:
1. `PoW` - Proof of Work
2. `PoS` - Proof of Stake

- `Sybil Attack` is when one node tries to manipulate the decentralised network thinking that it's several nodes but it's actually one node.
- `51% Attack` is when a group of network occupies 51% of the network making it able to move the network to a given direction.
- `Proof Of Work` costs a lot of electricity.
- `Proof Of Stake` uses much less energy.

## 2. Welcome to Remix - Simple Storage
- Create accounts on `Ethereum Stack Exchange`, `ChatGPT`, `Phind` and even `DeepSeek-R1`.
- *`Repetition Is The Mother Of Skill!`*
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Remix has a lot of features that allows us to interact with smart contracts.
- Remix is used by top auditors and developers in the web3 space.
- Solidity Syntax.
- Always comment your code.
- Basic Data Types.
- Have a good format that does not make the code look ugly.
- Solidity Arrays & Structs.
-

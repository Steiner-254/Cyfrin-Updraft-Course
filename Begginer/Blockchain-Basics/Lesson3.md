# The Purpose Of Smart Contracts & Blockchain

## The Essence of Blockchain and Smart Contracts
- Almost every interaction or transaction in our lives involves some form of agreement or contract.
- A Smart Contract is:
>> Immutable (cannot be altered)

>> Automatically executes

>> Have terms and conditions.

## The Problem with Traditional Agreements
- Consumer Trust
- Banking and Trust
- Financial Markets Access

## N/B:
- Smart contracts are relatively new, but have already started transforming various markets. They do this by representing 'promises' as code on the blockchain. This code is executed by a decentralized collective, such that no single entity can alter the agreemeent in any way! The agreement and it's terms are public knowledge and will automatically execute without human intervention.
- More industries are adopting smart contracts and blockchain due to the numerous advantages they offer. This results in trust-minimized agreements or what can be simply termed as unbreakable promises.
- Blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies are not just about trust-minimized agreements. They offer security benefits, uptime advantages, execution speed, and much more.

## Wrap Up
- What we've learnt is that traditional contracts or agreements between parties are almost always trust based. Trust based agreements come with inherent flaws and the potential of broken agreements, the conseequences of which we've seen throughout history - The Great Depression, Monopoly Lottery, Robin Hood etc.
- Blockchain technology and smart contracts solve these problems by introducing fairness, transparency and immutability to promises. These attributes of smart contracts assure that trust isn't required and we can be certain that an agreement will be executed as described 100% of the time.
- Lastly, it's important to note that there are several actors, such as FTX which pretend to embody the ideologies of Web3, but are really centralized entities looking to extract value from the system, be aware of these.

# Gas in depth

## Transactions and Gas
- In this lesson we're going to take a an even closer look at gas, how it functions and the purpose it serves on the blockchain.
- Don't stress if this topic sounds complex; gas can absolutely be a confusing topic, but the more experience you gain and more examples we go through, it'll start to become clear.

>> Note: What we're covering here is applicable to Ethereum post implementation of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) wherein gas limits, priority fees and the discussed burn mechanism were all introduced.

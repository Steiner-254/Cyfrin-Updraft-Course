# Signing transactions

## Public and Private Keys
- In this lesson, all the pieces we learnt about with Metamask should start coming together.
- Understanding the relationship between private and public keys is essential to grasping the concept of blockchain transactions. In essence, a private key is a randomly generated secret key used to sign all transactions.
- The private key is then passed through an algorithm (the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for Ethereum and Bitcoin) to create the corresponding public key. Both the private and public keys are central to the transaction process. However, while the private key must remain secret, the public key needs to be accessible to everyone.
- When we send a transaction to the blockchain, we're passing a private key - this allows others to verify the transaction through the generated public key

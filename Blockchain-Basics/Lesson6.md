# Introduction To Gas
- In this lesson, we will discuss important concepts ranging from transaction fees and gas prices, mining incentives, computational measures in transactions, to hands-on experience of sending a transaction in Ethereumâ€™s test network.
Let's jump right in!

## Transaction Fee and Gas Price: What are they?
- While inspecting an Ethereum transaction, two terms invariably catch the glance: "transaction fee" and "gas price". Let's clarify what they are and why they matter.

>> The transaction fee is the amount rewarded to the block producer for processing the transaction. It is paid in Ether or GWei. 

>> The gas price, also defined in either Ether or GWei, is the cost per unit of gas specified for the transaction. The higher the gas price, the greater the chance of the transaction being included in a block.

- Gas price is not to be confused with gas. While gas refers to the computational effort required to execute the transaction, gas price is the cost per unit of that effort.

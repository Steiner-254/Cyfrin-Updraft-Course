# Setup your wallet - making your first transaction

## Setting up Metamask for Ethereum Transactions
- In this section, we will learn how to make a transaction on a test Ethereum blockchain using Metamask, a popular cryptocurrency wallet.

## Visiting Ethereum Website
- Go to the Ethereum website https://ethereum.org/.

## Understanding Blockchains
- We will make our first transaction on a test Ethereum blockchain.
- This process works the same across all EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains and layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Ethereum, ZK Sync, etc.

## Setting up Metamask Wallet
- To set up a wallet, we really just need to follow these steps:
1. To send a transaction on EVM chains, set up a wallet. We'll use Metamask as it's one of the most popular and easiest wallets to start with.
2. Go to Metamask.
3. Install the Metamask extension for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Brave).
4. Once installed, you’ll see the extension in the top-right corner of your browser.
5. Click "Get Started".
6. Select "Create a New Wallet".
7. Agree to help Metamask improve (optional).
8. Create a password. Make sure it’s secure.

> **Note**: This wallet will be for development purposes, so you may use a weaker password. But never put real money into this wallet. Treat it as a real wallet to familiarize yourself with good wallet safety.

## Secret Recovery Phrase (Master Key)
- Metamask is going to provide you with a secret recovery phrase. This is a series of 12 words generated when you first set up Metamask. Ultimately this phrase will allow you to recover your wallet and funds within, should you ever lose access.
- This recovery phrase (sometimes referred to as a mnemonic) is your master key, so keep it safe. Write it down, store it in a safe deposit box, or use a secure password manager. Some even engrave their phrase on a metal plate.

>> Warning: If anyone gets access to your secret recovery phrase, they can access and take all your funds. No one, including the Metamask team, can help you recover your wallet if you lose the phrase.

## Understanding the Metamask Interface
1. Selecting a Network
- Near the top of the Metamask interface, you’ll see “Ethereum Mainnet”. Click on it to see all the networks that Metamask can access.

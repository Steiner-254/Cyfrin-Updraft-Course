# What is a blockchain?

- The Oracle Problem:

>> Smart Contracts cannot interact with or access data from the real world. To make smart contracts more useful and capable of handling real-world data, they need external data and computation.

## Terminologies

- Blockchain: In web3, a blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure and decentralized manner. Each block contains a number of transactions, and every new block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes the data tamper-resistant. Example: Bitcoin's blockchain records all BTC transactions.

- Oracle: Oracles in web3 are intermediaries that provide smart contracts with external data. They act as bridges between blockchains and the outside world, allowing smart contracts to execute based on real-world events and data. Example: A weather oracle provides data for a smart contract that triggers crop insurance payments based on rainfall data.

- Layer 2: Layer 2 solutions in web3 are technologies built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. These solutions handle transactions off the main chain, reducing congestion and fees, and then settle the final state on the main chain. Example: The Lightning Network for Bitcoin.

- Dapp (Decentralized Application): A Dapp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. It is powered by smart contracts and operates without a central authority. Dapps can serve various purposes, from finance to gaming. Example: Uniswap, a decentralized finance application.

- Smart Contract: In web3, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchains and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. Example: A smart contract for an escrow service.

- Hybrid Smart Contract: Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain code (running on a blockchain) with off-chain data and computations provided by oracles. This allows the contracts to interact with data and systems outside their native blockchain. Example: A smart contract for insurance that uses real-world data (like weather or flight delays) provided by oracles.

- Ethereum/EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine): Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects. Example: ERC-20 tokens, a standard for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum.

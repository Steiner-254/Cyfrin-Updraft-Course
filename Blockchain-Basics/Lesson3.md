# The Purpose Of Smart Contracts & Blockchain

## The Essence of Blockchain and Smart Contracts
- Almost every interaction or transaction in our lives involves some form of agreement or contract.

## The Problem with Traditional Agreements
- Consumer Trust
- Banking and Trust
- Financial Markets Access

## N/B:
- Smart contracts are relatively new, but have already started transforming various markets. They do this by representing 'promises' as code on the blockchain. This code is executed by a decentralized collective, such that no single entity can alter the agreemeent in any way! The agreement and it's terms are public knowledge and will automatically execute without human intervention.
- More industries are adopting smart contracts and blockchain due to the numerous advantages they offer. This results in trust-minimized agreements or what can be simply termed as unbreakable promises.
- Blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies are not just about trust-minimized agreements. They offer security benefits, uptime advantages, execution speed, and much more.

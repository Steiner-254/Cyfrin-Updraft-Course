# Foundry setup
- ***This session guides you through setting up the `Foundry environment` for `NFT development`. It includes instructions on creating directories, initializing your project, and using OpenZeppelin contracts for defining NFTs, highlighting the process of minting and deploying NFT images.***

### Foundry Setup
- Now that we know what an NFT is, let's investigate how we can build our own. As always the code we're writing will be available in the **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-nft-cu)** associate with this section.
- To start, let's initialize our workspace. Create a new directory in your course folder.

```bash
mkdir foundry-nft
```

- We can then switch to this directory and open it in VSCode.

```bash
cd foundry-nft
code .
```

- Finally, we can initialize our foundry project.

```bash
forge init
```

- Once initialized, be sure to remove the example contracts `src/Counter.sol`, `test/Counter.t.sol` and `script/Counter.s.sol`. Finally, assure that your `.gitignore` contains `.env` and `broadcast/`

### NFT Contracts
- Now, as mentioned previously, NFTs are just another type of **[Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)**, similar to ERC20s. As such, we could simply write our contract and begin implementing all the necessary methods to comply with this standard. However, like ERC20s, we can also just import a library (like OpenZeppelin) which does all this heavy lifting for us.
- Begin by creating `src/BasicNft.sol` and setting up our usual boilerplate.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract BasicNft{}
```

- We can install the OpenZeppelin Contracts library with:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

- To make things a little easier on ourselves, we can add this as a remapping to our `foundry.toml`. This remapping allows us to use some short-hand when importing from this directory.

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
remappings = ["@openzeppelin/contracts=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts"]
```

- Now we can import and inherit the ERC721 contract into `BasicNft.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract BasicNft is ERC721 {}
```

- Your IDE will likely indicate an error until we've passed the necessary arguments to the ERC721 constructor. You can ctrl + left-click (cmd + left-click) on the imported ERC721.sol to navigate to this contract and confirm what the constructor requires.

```solidity
constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {
    _name = name_;
    _symbol = symbol_;
}
```

- Just like the ERC20, we need to give our token a name and a symbol, that makes sense. Feel free to choose your own, but I'm going to go with the name `Doggie` and the symbol `DOG`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract BasicNft is ERC721 {

    constructor() ERC721("Doggie", "DOG"){}
}
```

- Great! While this contract may have the basic functionality of an NFT protocol, there's a lot to be done yet. Because each token is unique and possesses a unique tokenId, we absolutely need a token counter to track this in storage. We'll increment this each time a token is minted.

```solidity
uint256 private s_tokenCounter;

constructor() ERC721("Doggie", "DOG"){
    s_tokenCounter = 0;
}
```

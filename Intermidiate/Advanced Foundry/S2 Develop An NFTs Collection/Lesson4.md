# Introduction to IPFS
- **Learn about the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage system, and its use in NFT development. Understand the concept of hashing data, pinning it on IPFS nodes, and the global network of nodes, differentiating it from blockchain in terms of data storage and access.**

### IPFS
- In this lesson let's dive into the `Interplanetary File System (IPFS)`, how it works and what it means for decentralization of data. You can find additional information in the **[IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/)**
- So, how does IPFS work?
- It all starts with the data we want hosted. This can be more or less anything, code, images, some other file, it doesn't matter. As we know, any data can be hashed and this is essentially what IPFS Node's do initially. We provide our data to the IPFS network via a Node and the output is a unique hash that points to the location and details of that data.

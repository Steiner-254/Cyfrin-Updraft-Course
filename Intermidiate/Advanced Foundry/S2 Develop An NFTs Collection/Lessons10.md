# Deploy your NFTs on the testnet
- ***Guides on deploying NFTs to a testnet and importing them into MetaMask. It covers the use of Anvil for deployment, extracting contract data, and using MetaMask to interact with the deployed NFTs.***

## Obtaining testnet funds -> Tenderly virtual testnets
- Obtaining testnet funds can be difficult as faucets often require you to hold mainnet funds or sign in with some other service like GitHub.
- So, instead of deploying and interacting on a testnet like Sepolia, you can use a Tenderly virtual testnet. More information on creating your own virtual testnet can be found in [this video](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics/basics/sending-your-first-transaction-tenderly)!
- Note that, as of today, Tenderly does not support ZKsync.

### Basic NFT Testnet Demo
- Seeing our NFT minting in our tests is cool and all, but to really appreciate them, we want to see them in our wallet. We want to see the art _in_ Metamask, _on_ OpenSea, we gotta make it real.

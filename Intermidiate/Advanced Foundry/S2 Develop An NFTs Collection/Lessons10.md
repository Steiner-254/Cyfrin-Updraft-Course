# Deploy your NFTs on the testnet
- ***Guides on deploying NFTs to a testnet and importing them into MetaMask. It covers the use of Anvil for deployment, extracting contract data, and using MetaMask to interact with the deployed NFTs.***

## Obtaining testnet funds -> Tenderly virtual testnets
- Obtaining testnet funds can be difficult as faucets often require you to hold mainnet funds or sign in with some other service like GitHub.
- So, instead of deploying and interacting on a testnet like Sepolia, you can use a Tenderly virtual testnet. More information on creating your own virtual testnet can be found in [this video](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics/basics/sending-your-first-transaction-tenderly)!
- Note that, as of today, Tenderly does not support ZKsync.

### Basic NFT Testnet Demo
- Seeing our NFT minting in our tests is cool and all, but to really appreciate them, we want to see them in our wallet. We want to see the art _in_ Metamask, _on_ OpenSea, we gotta make it real.
- So let's do that.
- Before we get started, I'll mention you don't _have_ to do this yourself. This process will cost testnet funds, so it's fine to just follow along if needed. An alternative way to view your NFT would be to import your Anvil chain into Metamask and continue to use your local blockchain. If that works for you, great! Otherwise, let's continue with deploying this on an actual testnet.
- We'll be leveraging a Makefile for this again, I'll just be copying mine from the GitHub repo associated with this course, I've also provided it below for your convenience.

- Makefile:

```makefile
-include .env

.PHONY: all test clean deploy fund help install snapshot format anvil

DEFAULT_ANVIL_KEY := 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80

```

- Assuming our `.env` is ready to go, we should be able to run the following...

>>‚ùó **PROTIP** Remember to add the required environment variables if necessary. You should need a `sepolia RPC-URL`, an `account private key` and an `etherscan api key`.

```bash
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

### Wrap Up
- Amazing work! We've deployed an NFT protocol to a testnet, we've minted ourselves an NFT programmatically, and we've imported that Token right into our wallet. Our adorable Pup is our to do with as we please!
- We've learnt so much already and you should be very proud, but it's not time to stop yet. In the next lesson we'll discuss the pros and cons of data storage and the services and methodologies available to us.
- Let's gooo!

- While testing is a vital part of NFT creation, deploying it in a real use case can bring more clarity to your understanding. Luckily, there are several ways to deploy your NFT. You could consider using Anvil, your own Anvil server, or a testnet. If you're not keen on waiting for the testnet or spending the gas, I'd recommend deploying it to Anvil.

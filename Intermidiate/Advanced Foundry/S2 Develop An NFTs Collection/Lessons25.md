### Verifying MetaMask Transactions
- Possessing this better understanding of encoding empowers us to do something very cool, and that's verify the transactions in our Metamask wallet before signing them.
- If we write to a contract on Etherscan, a transaction will pop up in our Metamask wallet, by navigating to the HEX tab, we can see the data being sent in this transaction.

# What is an NFT
- ***Dive deep into the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), exploring their uniqueness compared to traditional tokens (ERC20s). The lesson focuses on the distinct nature of NFTs, their application in digital art, and the use of platforms like OpenSea and Rarible for trading.***

### What is a NFT?
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a product of the **[ERC721 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)**, created on Ethereum.
- NFTs are:

>> `Non-fungible`: This means they are explicitly `unique` from one another and one NFT `cannot be interchanged` with another.

- Fungible tokens, like ERC20s are similar to a dollar. Any single dollar can be swapped with any other and no value is lost. NFTs by contrast are unique in themselves with different properties from token to token.

>> ‚ùó **PROTIP** Think of NFTs like Pokemon! No two Pikachus are exactly the same and there are many different types within the same class or collection. Other comparisons include: trading cards, unique pieces of art

### What's an NFT do?
- Because of their unique nature, NFTs have been widely adopted as a medium for art and a means to trade and collect digital art. Sometimes this gets a bad rap, but NFTs are only a standard on which a tonne of use case functionality can be built. Some protocol turn them into representations of game assets, or into tradeble metaverse items, sometimes they're used as means to keep record, or grant access to services or events.
- The use cases of NFTs grow each day, but the easiest way to think of them currently is as unique digital assets, or unique digital art.
- At their core, NFTs are tokens which exist on a smart contract platform, they can be viewed, bought and sold on marketplaces such as **[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)** and **[Rarible](https://rarible.com/)**. The marketplaces aren't required of course, but the UI/UX is generally better than a command line.

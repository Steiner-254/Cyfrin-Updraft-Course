# What is an SVG?
- ***Explains Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs), their advantages, and how to create them. The lesson includes coding snippets for SVG creation and highlights their use in NFTs for on-chain storage.***

### What is an SVG?
- To understand what an `SVG` is, we'll dive right into a helpful tutorial from our friends at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp). SVG stands for `Scalable Vector Graphics`. In 'simple' terms, SVG is a way to define images in a two-dimensional space using XML coded tags with specific parameters.

**SVG Example:**

```js
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My first SVG</h1>

    <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <circle
        cx="50"
        cy="50"
        r="40"
        stroke="green"
        stroke-width="4"
        fill="yellow"
      />
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Explore Open Zeppelin
- ***Explore the use of the `OpenZeppelin` framework for smart contract development. Learn how to leverage pre-deployed, audited, and ready-to-go contracts to simplify the creation process of your ERC20 token.***

### ERC20 OpenZeppelin
- Welcome back! As mentioned in the closing of our last lesson, we could absolutely continue with manually building out a smart contract comprised of all the required functions to be compatible with the ERC20 standard, but wouldn't it be more convenient to use pre-deployed, audited, and ready-to-go contracts?
- In this section, I'll guide you on using the OpenZeppelin Library to achieve this.

>> ❗ **NOTE** OpenZeppelin is renowned for its Smart Contract framework, offering a vast repository of audited contracts readily integrable into your codebase.

1. What is an ERC20 token?


A digital token, where, when in your possession, your blockchain wallet downloads a signed copy of the amount of tokens you hold to be stored locally in an encrypted file on your device.


A physical token you can purchase at the store.


`A smart contract that follows the ERC20 standard and keeps track of balances using storage variables in the contract.`


A native gas token that has been wrapped in a separate RPC to be viewed with a different set of instructions

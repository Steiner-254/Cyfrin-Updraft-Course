### Security & Auditing Introduction
- Welcome back! This is our final lesson in this course and we're ending on a thrilling note - diving into the world of **smart contract security and auditing**.
- Remember, this is _just a teaser_ and won't cover everything about security, nonetheless, we'll ensure you're armed with the fundamentals to keep your protocol secure and that you know where to ask for help when you need it and it's time to deploy.
- Let's start with some scary statistics to demonstrate the motivations behind improving Web3 security.
- In 2022, according to data from Chainalysis there were $3.8 Billion work of hacks in crypto, $3.1 Billion from DeFi specifically. To put this into perspective, according to DeFi Llama, as of recording, there's \$47.5 Billion `TVL - Total Value Locked` in all of DeFi. This means a staggering 6.5% of all the money in DeFi was hacked/stolen.
- That's insane. Imagine a bank telling you there was a 6% chance that everything you deposit will be gone next year.
- There's a popular website, **[rekt.news](https://rekt.news/)** which tracks crypto hacks and even has a leaderboard ranking the largest hacks of all time. What's so shocking (or not shocking) is how many of these hacked protocols went `unaudited`.

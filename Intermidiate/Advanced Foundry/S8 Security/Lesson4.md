# Top security tools
- ***Overview of various security tools used by professionals for smart contract auditing, including their roles and effectiveness.***

### Top Tools used by Security Professionals
- Welcome back! Now that you have a basic understanding of what a smart contract audit involves, let's take a deeper look into the auditing process employed by security professionals and some of the tools they use to secure your code.
- Being aware of the tools available in this space will even give you as developers the opportunity to employ them _during_ development. Security isn't something you can just tack onto the end of a development cycle as is best approached as a foundational consideration from the very start of development.
- A couple useful GitHub repos I'll point out straight away include:

>> * **[solcurity](https://github.com/transmissions11/solcurity)**

>> * **[simple-security-toolkit](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit)**

- These are great avenues to ensure your protocol is ready for an audit. The latter even includes an **[audit-readiness-checklist](https://github.com/nascentxyz/simple-security-toolkit/blob/main/audit-readiness-checklist.md)** to help you prepare.

### The Audit Process
- There's no silver bullet and each individual audit may be slightly different from the last, but here's a general outline of the process a protocol will undergo when under audit.

>> * Manual Review
   * -- Go through the Code & Docs
   * -- Understand what the protocol should do

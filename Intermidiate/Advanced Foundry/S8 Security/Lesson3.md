# What is a smart contract audit
- ***Insights into the manual review process in smart contract auditing, emphasizing the importance of detailed code and documentation examination.***

### What is a Smart Contract Audit?
- A smart contract audit is a timeboxed, security based code review of a smart contract system.
- An auditor's goal is to find as many security vulnerabilities as possible and educate the protocol on best practices moving forward in development. Auditors leverage a variety of tools and expertise to find these vulnerabilities.

_**Why is a security audit so important?**_
- Well, the statistics I mentioned in the introduction speak for themselves. With billions of dollars being stolen from unaudited code, the industry can't afford _not_ to improve their security.
- The `immutability` of the blockchain renders patching and updating frequently impossible, impractical or expensive. So having confidence in the security of your code is key.

>> ❗ **IMPORTANT** The blockchain is a permissionless, adversarial environment, being prepared for malicious users is _integral_ to success.

- An audit can actually accomplish much more than just checking for bugs. An audit can:

>> * Improve your developer team's understanding of code

>> * Improve developer speed and efficiency

>> * Teach the latest tooling

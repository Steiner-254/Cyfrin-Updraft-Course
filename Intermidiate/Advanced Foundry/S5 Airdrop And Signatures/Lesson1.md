>> ***Welcome back! I'm Ciara, and I'll be guiding you through the Merkle Airdrop section of this course. In this project, we'll delve into **Merkle Trees** and **Signatures** to create our very own _ERC20 airdrop contract_.***

### Airdrop
- An airdrop occurs when a token development team distributes tokens or allows people to claim them. These tokens can be of various types, including **ERC-20**, **ERC-1155**, or **ERC-721**.
- Tokens are typically given for free, with eligibility criteria such as contributing to the project's GitHub repository or participating in the community. This process helps to _bootstrap the project_ by distributing tokens to a **list of eligible addresses**.

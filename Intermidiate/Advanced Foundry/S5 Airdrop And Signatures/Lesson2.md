# Project Setup
- Setting up the Foundry project and creating an ERC20 token to airdrop.

### Setup
- We can begin by creating a repository for our project with the command `mkdir merkle-airdrop` and navigate into it. Ensure you're on the regular version of Foundry by typing `foundryup` in your terminal. You can then run `forge init` to initialize an empty foundry project.

- One of the most important parts of development is sharing the stuff you work on for other people to see and contribute to. If you don't want to do that you still need a system for version control, a place where you save different stages of your project that can be accessed as simple as pressing 3 clicks. As you've guessed by now the thing we'll introduce now is GitHub.

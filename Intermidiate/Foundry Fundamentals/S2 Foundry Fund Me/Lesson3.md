# Introduction to smart contracts testing
- ***A guide on testing smart contracts using the \`forge test\` command and the \`counter.t.sol\` example, emphasizing the importance of test-driven development in programming.***

## Analyzing the `Counter` contracts
- Continuing from the previous lesson, the `forge --init` populated our project with the Counter files.

## Counter.sol
- It's a simple smart contract that stores a number. You have a function to `setNumber` where you specify a `newNumber` which is a `uint256`, and store it, and you have a function to increment the number. Note: `number++` is equivalent to `number = number + 1`.

## Counter.s.sol
- Just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything. 

## Counter.t.sol
- This is the interesting part. We haven't talked that much about carrying tests using `Foundry`. This is an essential step for any project. The test folder will become our new home throughout this course. Please run the following command in your terminal: 

```
forge test
``` 

- After the contracts are compiled you will see an `output` related to tests:

>> How many tests were found;

>> In which file;

>> Did they pass or not?;

>> Summary;

## How does `forge test` work?
- `forge test` has a lot of options that allow you to configure what is tested, how the results are displayed, where is the test conducted and many more! Run `forge test --help` to explore the options. I suggest reading this [page](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests) and navigating deeper into the Foundry Book to discover how tests work. But in short, in our specific case:

>> Forge identified all the files in the test folder, went into the only file available and ran the `setUp` function.

>> After the setup is performed it goes from top to bottom in search of public/external functions that start with `test`.

>> All of them will be `called` and the `conclusion` of their execution will be displayed. By that we mean it will run all the `assert statements` it can find and if all evaluate to true then the test will pass. If one of the assert statements evaluates to false the test will fail.

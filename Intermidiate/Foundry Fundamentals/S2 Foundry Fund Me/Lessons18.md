# Introduction to Storage optimization
- ***In this lesson, you'll learn about optimizing Ethereum smart contract storage to reduce gas consumption. It covers storage variables, their impact on gas usage, and how to efficiently use storage and memory in Solidity. The lesson also includes practical examples using Anvil.***

## Optimizing GAS consumption by properly managing Storage
- **Storage** is the specific area within the blockchain where data associated with a smart contract is permanently saved. These are the variables that we defined at the top of our contract, before going into functions, also called `state variable` or `global variables`.
- Imagine yourself being in a giant locker room, and in each locker, you have a space of 32 bytes. Each locker (storage space) is numbered/labeled and its number/label acts as the key, in the key-value pair, thus using this number/label we can access what's stored in the locker. Think of state variables as the labels you give to these lockers, allowing you to easily retrieve the information you've stored. But remember, space on this shelf isn't unlimited, and every time you add or remove something, it comes at a computational cost. From the previous lessons, we learned that this computational cost bears the name of `gas`.
- So, being a tidy developer, you'll want to use your storage efficiently, potentially packing smaller data types together or using mappings (fancy ways of labeling sections of the locker) to keep things orderly and cost-effective.

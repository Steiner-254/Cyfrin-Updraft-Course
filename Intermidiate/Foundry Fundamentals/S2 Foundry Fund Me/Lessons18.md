# Introduction to Storage optimization
- ***In this lesson, you'll learn about optimizing Ethereum smart contract storage to reduce gas consumption. It covers storage variables, their impact on gas usage, and how to efficiently use storage and memory in Solidity. The lesson also includes practical examples using Anvil.***

## Optimizing GAS consumption by properly managing Storage
- **Storage** is the specific area within the blockchain where data associated with a smart contract is permanently saved. These are the variables that we defined at the top of our contract, before going into functions, also called `state variable` or `global variables`.

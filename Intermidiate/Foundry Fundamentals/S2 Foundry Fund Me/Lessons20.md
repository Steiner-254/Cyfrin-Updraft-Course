# Create integration tests
- ***Explore the creation of integration tests for Solidity smart contracts. This lesson covers the setup and execution of integration tests, ensuring that contract functions interact correctly with other system parts. It includes practical examples and a guide for setting up a comprehensive test suite.***

## Writing a README.md
- A `README` is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. It serves as an introduction to your project, explaining what it does, why it is useful, and how users can get started with it. This initial impression can significantly impact whether someone decides to explore your project further.
- There are multiple templates available on the internet, but generally, yours should include at least a Title, a Project Overview, a Getting Started Guide and maybe some Contribution Guidelines (if you are building an open-source project).
- A README is your project's face to the world, and investing time in making it clear, comprehensive, and engaging can significantly impact your project's success and community engagement.

## Integration tests
- To seamlessly interact with our contract, we need to create a programmatic for using it's functions.
- Please create a new file called `Interactions.s.sol` in the `script` folder.
- In this file, we will create two scripts, one for funding and one for withdrawing.
- Each contract will contain one script, and for it to work each needs to inherit from the Script contract. Each contract will have a `run` function which shall be called by `forge script` when we run it.
- In order to properly interact with our `fundMe` contract we would want to interact only with the most recent deployment we made. This task is easily achieved using the `foundry-devops` library. Please install it using the following command:

```javascript
forge install Cyfrin/foundry-devops --no-commit
```

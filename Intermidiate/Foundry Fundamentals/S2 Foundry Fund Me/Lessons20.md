## Writing a README.md
- A `README` is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. It serves as an introduction to your project, explaining what it does, why it is useful, and how users can get started with it. This initial impression can significantly impact whether someone decides to explore your project further.
- There are multiple templates available on the internet, but generally, yours should include at least a Title, a Project Overview, a Getting Started Guide and maybe some Contribution Guidelines (if you are building an open-source project).
- A README is your project's face to the world, and investing time in making it clear, comprehensive, and engaging can significantly impact your project's success and community engagement.

# Running tests on chains forks
- ***Instructions on running tests on forked blockchain chains, ensuring functional price feed integrations, and addressing issues related to non-existent contract addresses.***

## Forking tests
- This course will cover 4 different types of tests:

1. **Unit tests**: Focus on isolating and testing individual smart contract functions or functionalities.
2. **Integration tests**: Verify how a smart contract interacts with other contracts or external systems.
3. **Forking tests**: Forking refers to creating a copy of a blockchain state at a specific point in time. This copy, called a fork, is then used to run tests in a simulated environment.
4. **Staging tests**: Execute tests against a deployed smart contract on a staging environment before mainnet deployment.

# Deploy a smart contract locally using Ganache
- Guide on deploying smart contracts locally using `Ganache` and Foundry's `Anvil`, including setting up `Ganache`, using MetaMask for custom networks, and integrating Anvil.
- **Ganache** is an Ethereum developer tool that allows you to simulate a blockchain environment locally and test deployed smart contracts. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.

## Deploying a smart contract
- There are multiple ways and multiple places where you could deploy a smart contract. While developing using the Foundry framework the easiest and most readily available place for deployment is `Anvil`.

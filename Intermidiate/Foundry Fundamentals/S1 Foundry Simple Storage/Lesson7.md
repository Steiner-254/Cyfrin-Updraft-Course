## VS Code setup
- Installing VS Code extensions
1. `Open the Extensions view:` There are two ways to do this: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of VS Code. Use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (Mac).
2. `Browse or search for extensions:` The Extensions view displays featured extensions by default. Use the search bar to find a specific extension by name.
3. `Install the extension:` Once you've found the extension you want, click the "Install" button. VS Code will handle the download and installation process.

- ***That's it! The extension should be ready to use within VS Code***.
- Integrating AI into our work One of the best extensions that integrates AI in our development is `GitHub Copilot` Although it's a premium service, its intuitive AI-powered code autocomplete feature could be a game-changer for you. Of course, you can choose to go with other AI extensions based on your preferences. You can download GitHub Copilot [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot).

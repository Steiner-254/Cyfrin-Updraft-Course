# Interact with a smart contract using the CLI
- *Comprehensive guide on interacting with smart contracts using CLI and Foundry's Cast tool, detailing command usage for sending transactions and reading blockchain data.*.

## Interacting With Contract Addresses via Command Line & Foundry's Cast Tool
- This lesson builds on top of previous lessons where we deployed `SimpleStorage` via `forge script`. We have `Anvil` running and the smart contract is deployed. Copy the contract address.

## Sending information to the blockchain
- Foundry has an in-built tool known as `Cast`. `Cast` comes loaded with numerous commands to interact with. Learn more about them by typing `cast --help`. One such useful command is `send` which is designed to sign and publish a transaction. To view help about `send`, type cast `send --help`.

# Compile A Smart Contract Using Foundry
- Guide to compiling Solidity smart contracts using `Foundry`, including steps for using the Foundry console, understanding the `'out'` file, and terminal command recall.

## Compiling Smart Contracts: A Guide to the Foundry Console Compilation Process
- Open a new terminal. Type in `forge build` or `forge compile` to compile the smart contracts in your project. Once the compiling is finished, you'll see some new folders in the Explorer tab on the left side. One of them is a folder called **out**. Here you'll be able to find the `ABI` of the smart contract together with the `Bytecode` and a lot of useful information.

# Create a new Foundry project
- Step-by-step instructions on creating a new simple storage project using Foundry, including project folder setup, terminal tips, and initial project structure.

## More setup
- Make sure we are in the folder we created in the previous lesson. 
- **Reminder:** We ran the following commands ``` mkdir foundry-f23 && cd foundry-f23 ``` Now type the following commands: ``` mkdir foundry-simple-storage-f23 && cd foundry-simple-storage-f23 ``` 
- You can always make the *`cd`* command faster by pressing the Tab key after you type the first couple of letters from the destination name. Tab lets you autocomplete a lot of commands/paths. If you type *`code .`* a new instance of VS Code will open, having the `foundry-simple-storage-f23` as the default path. 
- You can see the contents of this folder on the left sidebar. Try the following command: ``` touch randomFile.txt ``` This will create a `randomFile.txt` If you want to delete it type: ``` rm randomFile.txt ``` The terminal is pretty slick when it comes to `moving/opening/creating directories/files`, changing paths and generally running things. I recommend going through [this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) if you want to learn how to move extra fast.

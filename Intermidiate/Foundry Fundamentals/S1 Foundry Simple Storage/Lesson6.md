# Foundry setup
- *`Step-by-step guide on installing and operating Foundry, a tool for smart contract development, compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.`*
- Welcome to this handy guide on installing and operating Foundry, a versatile tool that will add a new level of command-line ease to your developer journey. Whether you're running Windows, Linux or MacOS, we've got you covered with instructions and tips. So sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and let's dive in.

## Prepping your Terminal
- First things first. Before we dive into installing Foundry, make sure you have your terminal set up correctly.
- If you are using Windows, you should see something like ***WSL*** or ***Ubuntu***. Once you have your terminal environment ready, itâ€™s time for some quick tips to help streamline your workflow.

## Keeping your Terminal Clutter-free
- When commands pile up in your terminal, things can get a little overwhelming. Clear it up by simply typing ***clear*** and hitting ***Enter***. Alternatively, use ***Command K*** if you're on a Mac or ***Control K*** if you're on Linux or Windows.
- **Pro tip:** This is one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts that I use all the time.

## Understanding the Trash Can and the X
- The trash can and the X buttons in your terminal perform distinct functions. Hitting X simply hides your terminal but retains all the previous lines of code. On the other hand, trashing it essentially deletes whatever is running in it. To open up a clean terminal, hit the trash can and then pull it back using *`Toggle or Terminal > New Terminal`*.

## Installing Foundry
- With our terminal set and some tips up our sleeve, let's progress to installing Foundry. Navigate to the [Foundry website](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and from the installation tab, fetch the command to install Foundry.
- The command would look something like this:
```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
- Hit *`Enter`* after pasting this in your terminal.
- **Note:** You must have Internet access for this to work as it's downloading Foundry from their official website.

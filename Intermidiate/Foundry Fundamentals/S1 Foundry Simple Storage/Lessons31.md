# Wrap up, congratulations!
- ***Summary and congratulations on completing the Foundry project, highlighting key learnings, tools used, and encouraging continued learning and coding practice.***

## Celebrating Milestones in Foundry: A Complete Walkthrough of Our Recent Project
- You should feel a warm sense of accomplishment envelop you. Completing an entire project in Foundry is no mean feat. A hearty congratulation is in order for such an indomitable effort. This article serves as a quick, yet comprehensive, recap of everything we learnt in our project, proceeding into our next engagement. From the onset, rest assured, we are set to advance our Foundry skills, push upcoming projects on GitHub, and familiarize ourselves with advanced tooling.

## A Quick Trip Down Memory Lane: Key Takeaways from the Project
- Firstly, we journeyed through the process of creating a new Foundry project using `Forge` and `Knit`. These essential tools afforded us a structured, professional environment complete with folders to keep our work organized.
- We not only learnt about Foundryâ€™s basic commands but also their specific functionalities such as:

>> `Cast`: interacts with contracts that have been previously deployed.

>> `Forge`: compiles and interacts with our contracts.

>> `Anvil`: deploys a local blockchain, similar to another tool we used, Ganache.

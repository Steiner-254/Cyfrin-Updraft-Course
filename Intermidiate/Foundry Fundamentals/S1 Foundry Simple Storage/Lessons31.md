# Wrap up, congratulations!
- ***Summary and congratulations on completing the Foundry project, highlighting key learnings, tools used, and encouraging continued learning and coding practice.***

## Celebrating Milestones in Foundry: A Complete Walkthrough of Our Recent Project
- You should feel a warm sense of accomplishment envelop you. Completing an entire project in Foundry is no mean feat. A hearty congratulation is in order for such an indomitable effort. This article serves as a quick, yet comprehensive, recap of everything we learnt in our project, proceeding into our next engagement. From the onset, rest assured, we are set to advance our Foundry skills, push upcoming projects on GitHub, and familiarize ourselves with advanced tooling.

## A Quick Trip Down Memory Lane: Key Takeaways from the Project
- Firstly, we journeyed through the process of creating a new Foundry project using `Forge` and `Knit`. These essential tools afforded us a structured, professional environment complete with folders to keep our work organized.
- We not only learnt about Foundry’s basic commands but also their specific functionalities such as:

>> `Cast`: interacts with contracts that have been previously deployed.

>> `Forge`: compiles and interacts with our contracts.

>> `Anvil`: deploys a local blockchain, similar to another tool we used, Ganache.

- A pivotal part of our learning process was comprehending that sending a transaction via our MetaMask is tantamount to making an HTTP post request to a particular RPC URL. A similar RPC URL can be obtained from a node-as-a-service provider like Alchemy and used to send transactions directly from our Foundry projects.
- We obtained practical knowledge on how to compile code in Foundry and write a Solidity script for its subsequent deployment. We also find it critical to ensure the security of our private keys. Hence, throughout this course, we will be using an `.env` file. But be warned when dealing with real money, having your private key in plain text is not advisable.

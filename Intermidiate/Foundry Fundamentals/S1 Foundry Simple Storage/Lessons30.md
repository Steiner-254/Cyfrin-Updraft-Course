# Introduction to Alchemy
- *Introduction to Alchemy, a developer platform for Web3 applications, covering its features, benefits, and steps to create an account and use its services*.

## Alchemy: A Game Changer for Decentralized Application Development
- Innovation in the blockchain industry has come a long way, with powerful tools making their way into the ecosystem to support developers and bring efficiency to their workflows. Among these tools is `Alchemy`, and today we have `Vito`, the lead developer experience at Alchemy, to walk us through the platform, its features, and how you can leverage it to exponentially increase your productivity.

## What is Alchemy?
- `Alchemy` is a platform equipped with *APIs, SDKs, and libraries* to enhance your developer experience while working on Web3 projects. Think of `Alchemy as the AWS of Web3`. It functions as a node provider and developer tooling platform predominantly used in thousands of Web3 and Web2 applications, including large Web2 corporations like `Adobe, Shopify, and Stripe`.
- The need for platforms such as Alchemy arises from the fact that, as a developer, you don't usually have to worry about running the servers your code operates on or developing the deployment and integration pipelines for your application. Instead, you use services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for that—Alchemy does the same but for Web3.

## How Does Alchemy Work?
- `Alchemy` enhances your developer experience through a combination of features. The platform's primary component is the `Supernode`, a proprietary blockchain engine that works as a load balancer on top of your node.
- Like its name suggests, the `Supernode` ensures data from the blockchain is `always up-to-date and readily available`. Using the Supernode as a foundation, Alchemy has built the Enhanced APIs—a set of APIs that makes pulling data from the blockchain a breeze.

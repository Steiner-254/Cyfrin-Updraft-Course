# How Metamask interacts with dapps
- ***Introduction to MetaMask interactions with websites, covering the basics of transaction transparency and setting up a basic JavaScript web application.***

## In this lesson, we are going to learn:
1. How to quickly clone a repo in our terminal.
2. Use Live Server in VS Code to see our changes 'live' as we code.

## Key Concepts
1. `git clone` - command used to make a copy of a repository on your local machine.
2. `live server` - a VS Code extension that opens in your browser and automatically updates with your code.

## Overview
- Let's look at how what we've built interacts with a wallet. Remember, you can find all the code for this lesson **[here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/html-fund-me-f23)**.
- We won't be going over a whole full-stack application here, but the repo above contains a raw front-end you can try to replicate if you would like to challenge yourself.

>> Additional front-end content will be available on Updraft in the near future!

- Our focus will be on uncovering what's happening 'under the hood', allowing you to understand exactly what's going on when you interact with a website sending a transaction to the blockchain.

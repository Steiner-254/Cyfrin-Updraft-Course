# Introduction
- ***A beginner's guide to interacting with a website using your MetaMask wallet. The lesson covers the importance of understanding how your wallet interacts with websites, especially when sending transactions.***

- To get started, visit the GitHub repository and navigate to the [lesson 8](https://github.com/Cyfrin/html-fund-me-cu) codebase.
- In this section, we will delve into how MetaMask or your wallet interacts with websites and ensure that the transactions sent by the wallet are executed as intended. Although we won't be building a full-stack application here, we have plans to launch a comprehensive full-stack course soon. For now, our focus will be on the _HTML FundMe f23 project_, a basic, fully functional website built with raw JavaScript.

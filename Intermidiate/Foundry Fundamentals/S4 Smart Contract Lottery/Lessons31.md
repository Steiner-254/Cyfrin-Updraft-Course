## ### Creating a subscription using the UI

- Let's learn how to create a subscription using the Chainlink UI.

- First, you need to access this link: <https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia>

- Click on `Create Subscription`. On the next page, it's not necessary to put in any email address or project name. Click again on `Create Subscription`. Your Metamask will pop up, click on approve to approve the subscription creation. Wait to receive the confirmation then sign the message. After everything is confirmed you will be prompted to add funds, but let's not do that right now.
- Access the [first link](https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia) again. In this dashboard, you will see your new subscription in the `My Subscriptions` section. You could add this in your `HelperConfig` in the Sepolia section and everything would work.

# Setup the tests
- ***This lesson teaches the `setup` and `execution` of tests for smart contracts, emphasizing the significance of `forge coverage` and the `Arrange-Act-Assert` methodology to ensure robust and reliable smart contract functionality.***

## Continuing our testing journey
- Let's jump straight into testing! But where do we start?
- Easy! Let's call `forge coverage`:

```javascript
Analysing contracts...
Running tests...
| File                      | % Lines       | % Statements   | % Branches    | % Funcs       |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| script/DeployRaffle.s.sol | 100.00% (7/7) | 100.00% (9/9)  | 100.00% (0/0) | 100.00% (1/1) |
| script/HelperConfig.s.sol | 0.00% (0/9)   | 0.00% (0/13)   | 0.00% (0/2)   | 0.00% (0/2)   |
| src/Raffle.sol            | 2.94% (1/34)  | 2.33% (1/43)   | 0.00% (0/8)   | 7.69% (1/13)  |
| Total                     | 16.00% (8/50) | 15.38% (10/65) | 0.00% (0/10)  | 12.50% (2/16) |
```

- These numbers are weak! Let's improve them!
- In my opinion, when one needs to decide where to start testing there are two sensible approaches one could take:

1. Easy to Complex - start with view functions, then with smaller functions and advance to the more complex functions;
2. From the main entry point(s) to the periphery - what is the main functionality that the external user needs to call in order to interact with your contract;

- Patrick chose number 2. So what is the main entry point of our Raffle contract? The `enterRaffle` function.
- Let's look closely at it:

```javascript
function enterRaffle() external payable {
    if(msg.value < i_entranceFee) revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
    if (s_raffleState != RaffleState.OPEN) revert Raffle__RaffleNotOpen();

    s_players.push(payable(msg.sender));
    emit EnteredRaffle(msg.sender);
}
```

1. We check if the `msg.value` is high enough;
2. We check if the `RaffleState` is `OPEN`;
3. If all of the above are `true` then the `msg.sender` should be pushed in the `s_players` array;
4. Our function emits the `EnteredRaffle` event.

- Let's test point 1:

```javascript
function testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnough() public {
    // Arrange
    vm.prank(PLAYER);
    // Act / Assert
    vm.expectRevert(Raffle.Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent.selector);
    raffle.enterRaffle();
}
```

- We call `vm.prank(PLAYER)` to configure the fact that the next transaction will be called by the `PLAYER`. [Refresher](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/prank?highlight=prank#prank)
- After that we use the `vm.expectRevert` [cheatcode](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/expect-revert?highlight=expectRevert#expectrevert) to test if the next call will revert. We also have the option to specify the error message. You can do that by calling the `errorName.selector` as input of the `vm.expectRevert` cheatcode. Following that we call the `enterRaffle` without specifying the `value` of the transaction.
- Run the test using `forge test --mt testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnought`.

```javascript
Ran 1 test for test/unit/RaffleTest.t.sol:RaffleTest
[PASS] testRaffleRevertsWHenYouDontPayEnought() (gas: 10865)

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.99ms (161.70Âµs CPU time)
```

- We will skip point 2 for now, let's go straight to point 3:
- But before being able to test if a player is properly recorded in the `s_players` array we first need a view function to access the players in the `s_players`:

```javascript

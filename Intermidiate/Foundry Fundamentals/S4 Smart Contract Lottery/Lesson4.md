# Creating custom errors
- ***Guidance on using custom errors in Solidity for gas-efficient and effective error checking.***

### Implementing the `entranceFee`
- Great! Let's move on with writing the contract.
- Previously we defined the `i_entranceFee` variable. This is the amount the user has to send to enter the raffle. How do we check this?

```javascript
    function enterRaffle() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= i_entranceFee, "Not enough ETH sent");
    }
```

- First, we changed the visibility from `public` to `external`. `External` is *more gas efficient*, and we won't call the `enterRaffle` function internally.
- We used a `require` statement to ensure that the `msg.value` is higher than `i_entranceFee`. If that is false we will yield an error message `"Not enough ETH sent"`.
- **Note: The** **`require`** **statement is used to enforce certain conditions at runtime. If the condition specified in the** **`require`** **statement evaluates to** **`false`, the transaction is reverted, and any changes made to the state within that transaction are undone. This is useful for ensuring that certain prerequisites or validations are met before executing further logic in a smart contract.**
- In Solidity 0.8.4 a new and more gas-efficient way has been introduced.

### Custom errors
- [Custom errors](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/contracts.html#errors-and-the-revert-statement) provide a way to define and use specific error types that can be used to revert transactions with more efficient and gas-saving mechanisms compared to the `require` statements with string messages. If you want to find out more about how custom errors decrease both deploy and runtime gas click [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/custom-errors/).
- I know we just wrote this using the `require` statement, we did that because `require` is used in a lot of projects, that you might get inspiration from or build on top of and so on. But from now on we will perform checks using the `if` statement combined with custom errors.
- We will *refactor* `enterRaffle`, but before that let's define our custom error. Be mindful of the layout we talked about in the previous lesson

```javascript
error Raffle_NotEnoughEthSent();
```

- Now the `enterRaffle()` function:
```javascript
    function enterRaffle() external payable {
        // require(msg.value >= i_entranceFee, "Not enough ETH sent!");
        if(msg.value < i_entranceFee) revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
    }
```

- You will see that we named the custom error using the `Raffle__` prefix. This is a very good practice that will save you a ton of time when you need to debug a protocol with 20 smart contracts. You will run your tests and then ask yourself `Ok, it failed with this error ... but where does this come from?`. Because you thought ahead and used prefixes in naming your error you won't have that problem! Awesome!

- **Note:**
- **In Solidity, like in many other programming languages, you can write `if statements` in a single line for brevity, especially when they are simple and only execute a single statement. This is purely a stylistic choice and does not affect the functionality or performance of the code.**
- There is no difference between this:
```javascript
if(msg.value < i_entranceFee) revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
```

and this:

```javascript
if(msg.value < i_entranceFee) {
    revert Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
}
```

- Amazing work! Let's learn about events!

## ### Quick recap
- Congratulations, we wrote a bunch of great code!
- What did we do?

>> We implemented Chainlink VRF to get a random number;

>> We defined a couple of variables that we need both for Raffle operation and for Chainlink VRF interaction;

>> We have a not-so-small constructor;

>> We've created a method for the willing participants to enter the Raffle;

- ***Exploration of Solidity's code layout and function ordering for efficient smart contract development.***

- In the previous section we talked a bit about Solidity's style guide, code layouts and naming conventions. However, it's intriguing to note that we didn't fully explore how to properly order our Solidity functions. Solidity docs provide an `Order of Layout`:

# Deploy a mock Chainlink VRF
- ***The focus of this lesson is on deploying a mock Chainlink VRF, vital for testing smart contracts. It provides insights into setting up mock contracts, adjusting parameters, and the importance of Chainlink VRF in blockchain development.***

## Chainlink VRF mock contract
- A `mock` contract is a type of smart contract used in testing and development environments to simulate the behavior of real contracts. It allows us to create controlled and predictable scenarios for testing purposes without relying on actual external contracts or data sources. Moreover, it facilitates testing using Anvil, which is extremely fast and practical in comparison to a testnet.

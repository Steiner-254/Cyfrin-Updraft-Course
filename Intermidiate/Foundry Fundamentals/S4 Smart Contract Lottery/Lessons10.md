# The modulo operation
- ***Explanation of using the modulo operation for selecting random winners in smart contract games.***

## Understanding Modulo
- We ended the previous lesson when we defined the following function:

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {}
```

- As we've said before, this function is going to be called by the VRF service. Here we will be given 1 random word (1 because of the NUM\_WORDS we defined in the previous lesson). This isn't a `word` as in a string of letters like `pizza`, this is a big and random uint256. Being a number we can use it to do math.
- What we need is to use the `modulo` operator denoted as `%` in Solidity.
- The modulo operation (often abbreviated as "mod") is a mathematical operation that finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another. In other words, given two numbers, a and b, the modulo operation `a % b` returns the remainder of the `a / b` division.
- Examples:

```solidity
5 % 2 = 1 // Because 5 is 2 * 2 + 1
11 % 3 = 2 // Because 11 is 3 * 3 + 2
159 % 50 = 9 // Because 153 is 50 * 3 + 9

1000 % 10 = 0 // Because 1000 is 100 * 10 + 0
```

- We are going to use this function to pick a random winner.
- Let's say we have 10 players (`s_players.length = 10`).
- Now let's say Chainlink VRF sends back the number `123454321` (I know, super random).
- Given that the `% 10` operation can yield a value between \[0:9] we can use the result of the `randomNumber % 10` as the `s_players` index corresponding to the winner.
- Using the actual numbers:

```solidity
123454321 % 10 = 1
```

- This means that the player with index 1 (`s_players[1]`) is the winner of our raffle! The random number will always be different and sufficiently large. Using `s_players.length` will ensure that we always include all the players who paid a ticket. Perfect!

## Picking the winner
- Enough theory, let's implement it in code!

```solidity
    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
        uint256 indexOfWinner = randomWords[0] % s_players.length;
        address payable winner = s_players[indexOfWinner];
    }
```

- Now let's record this last winner in state and send them their prize.

```solidity
    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal override {
        uint256 indexOfWinner = randomWords[0] % s_players.length;
        address payable winner = s_players[indexOfWinner];
        s_recentWinner = winner;
        (bool success,) = winner.call{value:address(this).balance}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert Raffle__TransferFailed();
        }
    }
```

- Let's define the `Raffle__TransferFailed()` custom error and the `s_recentWinner` variable in the state variables section.

```solidity
    error Raffle__NotEnoughEthSent();
    error Raffle__TransferFailed();

    // Raffle related variables
    uint256 private immutable i_entranceFee;
    uint256 private immutable i_interval;
    uint256 private s_lastTimeStamp;
    address payable[] private s_players;
    address payable private s_recentWinner;
```

- Amazing! Let's keep going!

# Implementing Chainlink Automation
- ***Focusing on implementing Chainlink Automation, this lesson teaches how to use \`checkUpkeep\` and \`performUpkeep\` functions for automated execution in Chainlink-powered smart contracts, enhancing their autonomy and efficiency.***

## Implementing Chainlink Automation
- Remember how Richard deleted the `performUpkeep` and `checkUpkeep` in the previous videos ... we gonna need those if we want to use the Chainlink Automation without interacting with Chainlink's front-end. We are engineers, we do not use front-ends!

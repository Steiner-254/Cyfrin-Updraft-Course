# Smart contract lottery - Project setup
- ***Introduction to building an advanced lottery or raffle smart contract, covering key features like Chainlink automation and random number generation.***

### Getting Started
- Prepare yourself because this next project will be extremely awesome!
- For the project, we'll be working with an advanced lottery or raffle smart contract. This won't just be an exercise in coding, but a chance to learn more about:

>> * Events;

>> * On-chain randomness (done the proper way);

>> * Chainlink automation

>> * And many more!

- Please follow Patrick's presentation on the project we are going to build. Marvel at how good the code looks, pay attention to code structure, Natspec comments and all the other cool features.
- Hopefully, that sparked your interest. Now let's get cooking!

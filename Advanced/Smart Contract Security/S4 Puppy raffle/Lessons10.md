# sc-exploits-minimized
- ***Introducing the sc-exploits-minimized repo, a compilation of common smart contract vulnerability examples.***


- This code above is going to cause something called a Denial of Service or DOS.
- In order to get a better understanding of this bug, let's look at a _minimized_ example of it. If you reference the **[sc-exploits-minimized](https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized)** repo, as shown in the image below:

- This is an amazing resource to test your skills in general and familiarize yourself with common exploits. Additionally, the `src` folder of `sc-exploits-minimized` contains minimalistic examples of a variety of vulnerabilities as well.
- For now, let's check out the **[Remix example](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/Cyfrin/sc-exploits-minimized/blob/main/src/denial-of-service/DoS.sol\&lang=en\&optimize=false\&runs=200\&evmVersion=null\&version=soljson-v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6.js)** of the Denial of Service exploit in the next lesson.

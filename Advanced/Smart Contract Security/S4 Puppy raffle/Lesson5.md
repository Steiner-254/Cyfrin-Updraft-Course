# Tooling: Aderyn
- ***Introducing Aderyn: a static analysis tool for smart contracts, built with Rust by Alex Roan.***

### Introducing Aderyn: A Rust Based Static Analysis Tool
- The second powerful tool we'll be using in this course is a Rust-based analyzer, **[Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn)**. This tool was created by the smart contract developer legend **[Alex Roan](https://github.com/alexroan)**.

### Installation of Aderyn
- Before we can use `Aderyn`, we'll need to first install `Rust`. Like `Slither`, we won't go over the specifics of installation, but you can find a guide with installation options available to you **[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)**.

### Running Aderyn
- To run Aderyn, the command is `Aderyn [OPTIONS] <root>`. Since we're already in the root directory of our project, we can just run:

```bash
aderyn .
```
- Running this command will compile our contracts, our terminal will display the usual compilation warnings - at the bottom of the output however, we can see _`Detectors run, printing report. Report printed to ./report.md`_

### Aderyn Analysis Report
- This report was generated by [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn), a static analysis tool built by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io), a blockchain security company. This report is not a substitute for manual audit or security review. It should not be relied upon for any purpose other than to assist in the identification of potential security vulnerabilities.

### Wrap Up
- Fast, and efficient, **[Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn)** offers a swift vulnerability report of your smart contracts which is almost ready to be presented. Aesthetically neat and structurally organized, the tool is a quick starter for anyone performing security reviews. We'll be leveraging the power of Aderyn throughout the course!.
- Let's look at one more tool briefly in the next lesson.

### Re-entrancy a Menace
- Why am I stressing re-entrancy so much you might ask? The answer is simple.

> * We've known about it since 2016

> * It's easy enough to detect that static analyzers (like Slither) can identify them

> * Web3 is still hit by millions of dollars in re-entrancy attacks per year.

- This is so frustrating!

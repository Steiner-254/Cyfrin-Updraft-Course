### The Bright Side: The future of Web3 Security
- Security in Web3 is improving every day.

1. More and more people are moving into the security space in Web3. More auditors, more experts, more...safe!
2. Education is improving in Web3 Security and Web3 as a whole. People are more informed of best practices and what to watch out for
3. Tooling is improving - with AI and constantly developments in static analysis and vulnerability aggregation - we've never been more equipped to improve security in the space. [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/) in particular is a tool we'll come back to again and again in this course.

- **Protocols Playing It Safe:** More and more Web3 protocols are investing in security. They're auditing their code, they're opening bug bounties for post deployment coverage, they're finally realizing that spending $1 Million on security now, is worth saving $100 Million in being hacked.
- We also have an increase of pre-deployment experts like:

>> * Cyfrin

>> * Trail of Bits

>> * OpenZeppelin

- Competitive audit platforms ([CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/)), independent security researchers like ([Pashov](https://twitter.com/pashovkrum)) and a greater security focus all come together to make me optimistic about the future of Web3 Security.

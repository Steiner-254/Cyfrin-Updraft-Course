## Best Practices
- Welcome to our Smart Contract Security course! I'm super excited to guide you through this journey. Letâ€™s make sure you get the absolute best out of it.
- Essential Resources:

- * `Cyfrin Updraft` - If you're reading this, you're already here. All the most up to date corrections, content and updates will be available here, as accessible as ever and as part of a community eager to help.
- * `GitHub Repo` - The [Security and Auditing Full Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23) repo is going to be your bible throughout this course. It is packed with all the code and references you need to succeed.

- Now, let's talk about how you can really get into the groove of things:

- * **Code Along**: Trust me, coding along with me during the lessons will make things stick way better. Have the video up along with your IDE of choice and follow along. Actually going through these motions are what will commit them to memory.
- * **Join the Chat on GitHub**: Got questions? Want to chat with others? Head over to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Cyfrin/security-and-auditing-full-course-s23/discussions) tab. It's a great spot to talk things out.
- * **Stay Up-to-Date**: Remember, the world of coding changes fast. Keep an eye on Cyfrin Updraft for the latest and greatest in course content.
- * **Dive into the Community** - We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyfrin) server that is great for networking with fellow students and being involved in the community. Join us and share your successes and help others! To go far, we go together!

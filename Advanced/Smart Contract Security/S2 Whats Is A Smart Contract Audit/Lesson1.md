# What is a smart contract audit?
- ***This lesson delves into what a `smart contract audit`, or more accurately, a `security review`, truly entails. It discusses the three phases of a `security review`, the importance of these reviews in ensuring code security on immutable blockchain systems, and effective `techniques` used in the `process`. The lesson also emphasizes the distinction between the terms '`audit`' and '`security review`' and their implications in the context of blockchain and smart contracts.***

- You might think you've got a grip on what a smart contract audit is all about, but this lesson aims to help you dive deeper and truly comprehend the whole process. Brace yourself, as today we are stepping into the interesting realm of security reviews.
- Let's start off by stating that the term "smart contract audit" is a bit of a misnomer. As a more appropriate alternative, I am a stout advocate of "security review." I even have a T-shirt to prove my allegiance!
- You might be wondering why this change of terms is required. Well, itâ€™s because the term 'audit' might wrongly insinuate some kind of guarantee or even encompass legal implications. A security review, being free of these misconceptions, exudes the essence of what we are actually doing: looking for as many bugs as possible to ensure maximum code security.

# Installing Libraries
- ***Learn to use `OpenZeppelin` for `ERC20` token integration, including installation and contract creation. Insights into `ERC-721` as well.***

- We'll go over Fuzz and Invariant testing in more detail later. For now, let's briefly go over importing valuable libraries into our code base.

### OpenZeppelin Contracts and ERC20
- Say, you're working on a project and you'd like to include an `ERC20`, but are unsure where to start. This is where [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) come into play. This popular library, available on GitHub, provides prewritten contracts for your use, making your life a whole lot easier!
- Use the following command to install this library to your project directory:

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

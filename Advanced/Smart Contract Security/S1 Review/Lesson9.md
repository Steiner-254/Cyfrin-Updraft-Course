# Fallback and Receive
- ***Learn about the fallback and receive functions in Solidity. Investigate how these functions influence smart contract functionality.***

- In the world of Solidity smart contracts, it's important to understand the fallback and receive functions. By default, Solidity smart contracts reject any Ether (ETH) sent to them.
- In order to enable your contract to accept ETH, we would implement `fallback` and `receive` functions. Let's look at these mose closely.

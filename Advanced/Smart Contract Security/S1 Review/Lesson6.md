# What is an ERC721?
- ***What is an NFT? Learn the role of ERC-721 in representing unique digital assets on the blockchain.***

- The buzz around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or `ERC721s` lately is becoming impossible to ignore, especially within the spheres of art and blockchain technology. NFTs, originally authored on the Ethereum platform, present a unique form of digital asset that holds the potential to revolutionize the world of art, gaming and beyond. But what exactly are they?

## Understanding NFTs
- NFT stands for non-fungible token. Unlike `ERC20` tokens, such as LINK, DAI etc, each NFT is entirely unique, and no two tokens can be interchanged.
- To better understand, let's look at a simple analogy. Think of a dollar bill; it holds the same value as any other dollar out there. You can freely exchange a dollar for another, and their value remains the same. This makes them _fungible_. Contrastingly, an NFT is the complete opposite. It could be likened to a unique Pokemon. Each Pokemon is unique and no two Pikachu's are exactly the same.
- As a more relatable analogy, consider an NFT as a distinct piece of art, trading card, or any other one-of-a-kind item. So to sum up, NFTs are unique, non-interchangeable tokens best thought of as indestructible digital pieces of art with a permanent history detailing their ownership and alterations.

## The Many Uses of NFTs
- Although NFTs are mostly associated with art, they extend beyond that. They can be assigned any property, or manipulated in any way you like, thanks to the underlying smart contract technology.

- These unique tokens are deployed on a smart contract platform and can be traded on numerous NFT platforms such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or [Rarible](https://rarible.com/). While these decentralized marketplaces provide user-friendly interfaces for trading NFTs, one could just as easily buy and sell outside of them.

## NFTs: Bridging the Gap for Artists
- Many might find the whole concept of NFTs puzzling. Isn't art meant to be tangible? But consider this: artists often aren't adequately compensated for their work. Their creations get copied and shared with zero attribution; they simply lose ownership. But with NFTs, artists can finally get the recognition, and more importantly, the compensation they deserve.

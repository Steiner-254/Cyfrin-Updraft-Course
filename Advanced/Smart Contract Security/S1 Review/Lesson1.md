# Tooling Prerequisites
- This lesson provides an overview of the essential tools required for `Solidity and Smart Contract development`. It includes a guide to text editors like `Visual Studio Code` and `VSCodium`, and an introduction to frameworks such as `Foundry`, alongside compatibility tips for different operating systems. It also highlights the importance of `AI tools` like `Find` and `ChatGPT` in the development process.

## Pre-requisite Tools
- Before we get deep into coding, there are some useful tools we're going to be using throughout the course. Best to prepare them now.
- Firstly, you will need some kind of IDE or text editor. I like to use **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. For those of you more security and privacy focused you may want to check out **[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)** which removes a lot of the Microsoft _stuff_.

## Frameworks
- The primary framework we'll be working with in this course is Foundry. You can view installation instructions for that **[here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)**.
- But hey, if youâ€™re more familiar with **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)**, **[Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**, or any other framework, don't stress; you can absolutely follow along using your tools. We'll be tackling some Foundry-specific tasks, but you're always welcome to adapt them for your framework of choice.

>> Remember: You can use commands `foundryup` to update your Foundry tools and `forge --help` to access a help guide.

- Additional Foundry specific features we'll be using include `cast` and `chisel`, both of which we'll learn more about in this course.

## Coding Environment
- If you're using a PC with Windows, ensure you're using **Windows with WSL**.

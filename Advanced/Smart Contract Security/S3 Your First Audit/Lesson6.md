# "The Tincho"
- ***Learn how the legendary Tincho approaches his audits in this overview of his systematic technique, brought to us by Tincho himself!***

### Reconnaissance
- We've finally scoped out our client's code base and we're ready to dive into looking more closely at the code.
- To do this, we're going to learn some best practices and a technique I've dubbed `The Tincho` from the master himself - Tincho Abbate.

### Introducing Tincho
- Tincho is a legend in Web3 security and is a member of **[The Red Guild](https://theredguild.org/)**, a smart contract and EVM security firm. He was a previous lead auditor for the security firm at `OpenZeppelin` and he even helped me create this course!
- We're lucky to have Tincho walk us through his high-level way to approach security reviews.
- _What follows is derived from a video featuring Tincho's point of view_

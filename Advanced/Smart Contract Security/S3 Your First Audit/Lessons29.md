# Building Your Portfolio
- ***Creating a GitHub public repo for storing smart contract audit and security journey in PDF format. Build that portfolio and get your name out there!***

### Building a Portfolio
- Now that we've done all this amazing work, we absolutely need to show it off. The world needs to know what we're capable of.
- Create a new repository on your GitHub profile. Name it whatever you'd like. I'm going to name mine `updraft-security-portfolio`.

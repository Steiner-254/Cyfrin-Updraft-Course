# Recon: Understanding the code
- ***Demonstrates step-by-step approach, note-taking, communication with team. Gain understanding, identify vulnerabilities.***

### How Tincho Cracked the Code
- Tincho, was very pragmatic in his approach, literally going through the code line by line. This method might seem like he was looking for bugs/vulnerabilities in the code. But actually, he was just trying to understand the codebase better. In essence, understanding the functionalities and architecture of the code forms the first and most important part of code inspection.
- So let's take it from the top, just like Tincho didâ€¦

### Understanding What the Codebase Is Supposed to Do
- Our client's documentation has let us know what the intended functionality of the protocol are. Namely: A user should be able to store and retreive their password, no one else should be able to see it.
- Let's try to find this functionality within the code as we go through things line by line.

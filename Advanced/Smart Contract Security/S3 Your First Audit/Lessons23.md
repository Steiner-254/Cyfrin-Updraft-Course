# Quick Primer On What We Are Learning Next
- ***Audit data, severity ratings, PDF report creation. Instructions by Patrick on accomplishing tasks using tools & resources.***

### What comes next?
- Alright, we've made significant progress already. Reflecting on our development journey, we have notched up three substantial findings which are currently in our repository. However, our to-do list isn't finished yet. We still have two crucial aspects to iron out.
- First, our three findings need to be appended with their respective severity ratings. We're going to look into how best to determine a findings severity and adjust our report to reflect these assessments.
- Secondly, we need to convert our `findings.md` - a markdown file - into a professional-looking PDF that can be shared with protocols, and showcased on our portfolio. The PDF's we'll be creating are visible on the course's **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Cyfrin/3-passwordstore-audit/blob/audit-data/audit-data/report.pdf)**, so check them out.
- Let's get started with `determining a finding's severity`.
